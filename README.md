# Exploring_Data_with_SQL
This was my first project (after a long time) to explore Data with SQL and Tableau. 
It uses sales data of an online shop based in Brazil (called Magist database).
The presentation discusses whether or not a company in Europe (Eniac) should consider to use the online shop in Brazil to expand their market.

You can find the results of our analysis [here(Results/Presentation of Results_Is Magist a good fit for Eniac.pdf)]
